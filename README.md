# Generalised Arrays

We met with Hank, Neil, Piere on the 17th of July to discuss an idea to look
into specifications of the array theory that is based on containers.  We know
that there is a container operation that Hank suggested (a generalised tensor
product) and there is an idea of Neil to use containers as shapes.


This repository is a place to explore these ideas.
